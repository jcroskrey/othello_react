## Learning React with Othello
Welcome to my first React project. You can play the game on my [github page](https://github.com/jcroskrey/othello_react). I decided to create the board game Othello because it's a game I played in my childhood and I've been wanting to play it for a while. Instead of purchasing it, I figured why not create it with React? I used Bootstrap and some basic CSS for the styling of this project, but the main purpose of the project was to build some initial React skills, so forgive the "bootstrappy" look :P

The rules can be found on the official website [here](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english). Some of the features implemented are a reset button, undo button, and if no valid move is available then the player is forced to forfeit their turn. I've also implemented tests for this project using Jest and the react-testing-library.
